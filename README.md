# Heart-Disease-prediction-using-machine-learnig-techniques-and-WEKA-tool
We develop a model to predict heart disease based on 14 input parameters and were able to acheieve an accuracy of 76% using Naive Bayees algorithm.
# A Novel Approach using new DataSet and New Features <br>
The literature survey from the previously published papers did not mention the reason behind using only 14 features when we have many features.<br>
I tried something new and tried to find the reason behind using only one dataset given with multiple datasets<br>
The reason behind not using the other datasets is missing and corrupt Data<br>
